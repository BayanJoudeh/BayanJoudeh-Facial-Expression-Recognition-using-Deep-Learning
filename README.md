# Facial Expression Recognition using Deep Learning
This repository contains a project that uses deep learning techniques to recognize facial expressions from images. The project utilizes the [Yelp Polarity Reviews Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/yelp_polarity_reviews) from TensorFlow, which consists of text reviews labeled with sentiment polarity: positive or negative.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can predict the sentiment of a text review, whether it conveys a positive or negative emotion. The project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the sentiments based on the textual data.


## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset).
2. Open the provided Google Colab notebook (`face_expression_recognition_colab.ipynb`).
3. Follow the instructions inside the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the images, build the model, and train the neural network.
4. Evaluate the model on a test set of images and analyze the results.
